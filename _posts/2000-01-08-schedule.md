# Schedule

The congress will run during 3 days starting the 6th of November in the afternoon up to the 8th of November. We will 
have multiple types of activities running during these days which will include networking, social activities and 
professional development talks on different areas of expertise.

Here we show a rough schedule of what we have planned for the whole stay, all the workshops and events will take 
place in different rooms located in the Electrum building of KTH ICT Kista Campus.

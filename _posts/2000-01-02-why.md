## This is going to be a unique IEEE experience in the nordics!

On behalf of the organising committee and Sweden Section, it gives us great pleasure to invite you to the 1st IEEE 
Nordic Student and Young Professionals Congress - NordicSYP 2015. 

It is an opportunity not to be missed. All participants will have a chance to learn new skills during our workshops 
and learn about new trends in science and technology, as well as share a significant and unique experience with other 
IEEE colleagues. Nordic SYP 2015 is a great place to learn everything you want to know about IEEE and other student 
branches.

Even you will be able to have a taste of culture and life by living among the descendants of the Vikings itselfs!

We have prepared an excellent social program which gives  students and young professionals an opportunity to explore 
the city of Stockholm, relax and after all have fun.
